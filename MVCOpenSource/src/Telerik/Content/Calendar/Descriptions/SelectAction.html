    This example shows how Telerik Calendar for ASP.NET MVC can be used to navigate to <i>Action</i> method passing the clicked date.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Selection(...)</strong> method gives the ability to set an <strong>Action</strong> method and a collection of dates.
    Calendar will render action links for every date in the collection. Thus if the date is part of the rendered month view, the day will
    be wrapped in a link tag with <strong>URL</strong> pointing to the Action method.
</p>
<p>
    If only <strong>Action</strong> method is set, then all days will be wrapped in links with <strong>URL</strong> to the 
    defined <em>Action</em>.
